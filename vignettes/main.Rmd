Eyer allows for saving data in a predefined structure and then loading them from passed folder. The package comes with both `eyer_data` object for testing and demosntrations, but also with raw data you can look at and test loading. It is generally installed into `system.file("extdata", package = "eyer")` system folder.

```{r}
loading_folder <- system.file("extdata", package = "eyer")
eye <- load_eyer_data(loading_folder)
str(eye)
```

The eyer object then allows us to do some quick operations and visualisations
```{r}

```

and after we are finished, we can save the data again 

```{r}
save_eyer(eye, "temp", "preprocessed")
list.files("temp")
```
